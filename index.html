    <h3 class="w3-justify">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">We live in a noisy world, and often times it is difficult to escape all that noise in our busy lives. Many people struggle with getting in the right headspace for productivity. There are so many distractions that is it difficult to focus when studying or doing projects, and oftentimes music and podcasts can take our attention away even when intended for focusing. Our goal is to give users the tools to create detailed and varied soundscapes for a number of applications. These applications include media projects involving sound (e.g. foley for a film), assistance for studying or sleeping, or helping an individual or group of people to relax (e.g. yoga or meditation). There are some websites that attempt to accomplish this, but we believe they don't go far enough or are limited in their scope. Our intention is to create a functional but pleasing interface that allows users to control the world of sound. We also have a number of features that intend to expand the functionality of this product such as presets, downloadable soundscapes, and being able to upload custom sounds. There's a lot of potential, and we want to ensure that our product is well-designed and accomplishes everything that a user could want from an ambient sound generator.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-justify">Key Stakeholders</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">This product provides users with a selection of high quality background sounds as well as a tool to assist with user customization. The primary users of this product would include those who need assistance with working or relaxing. These users would include students trying to study or do homework, people who have difficulty falling asleep, and people who are simply looking for an escape from a noisy environment. This product could also be valuable to those who desire a natural atmosphere but live in an urban environment. Other primary users of this application might be people working in the Foley departments of digital media. These users could use the app as a resource for finding and mixing background sound effects for their scenes.</p>
